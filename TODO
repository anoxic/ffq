use this folder structure 
   app/ for configuration
   bin/ for scripts
   src/ for code (src/views for templates)
   var/ for object storage, etc
   web/ for public, css, other assets
   vendor/ for external libraries
   spec/ for tests (might never do this)

user storage a little more permanant than a two-col password file

Organizations
    * for now, just add an "org id" column at the beginning of "passwords"

Tasks
    * var/store/<org>/segment/<hash>/task.<int>
    * var/store/<org>/task/<hash> - contains priority type title desc done
    * var/store/<org>/slug/task.<int>
    * var/store/<org>/slug/<slug>

Color groups (for folders)
    * a simple way to store these - var/store/color/<prefix> (contains hex, hsb, etc)
    * an interface that displays the folders with a color input next it

Internal Storage
    new storage using git, maybe (also allow for different organization buckets)
    * var/store/<org>/                   - initialized git repository
    * var/store/<org>/pages/<hash>       - git versioned page, hash of some initial values
    * var/store/<org>/slugs/<slug>       - git versioned slug, contains page hash
    * var/store/<org>/tags/<tag>/<pages> - just an idea, could store tagged things here
    git author would be: "username" <org:userid>

For the heck of it
    switch router from bento to nikic/fastroute

Functionality
    default user generator
    signup page
    add "meta template" abilities for more customized use
    add ability to set a page as "public" and to specify an allowed domain and slug

Parser
    user signatures ~<username>
    user callouts   @<username>
                    #<hashtags>

Metainfo
    warning while editing if someone else starts editing a file
    last viewed on
    view count
    what links here

Theming
    ability to specify colors and fonts
    for this, use either an .ini or css var() http://www.myth.io

404s
    fuzzy suggest on 404 ("did you mean")
        similar_text()
        levenshtein()
        soundex()
        pspell_suggest()
    check if previous revision exists (git can track what slugs existed for pages)
    more friendly 404 wording

Maybe never
    federated wiki support http://ward.fed.wiki.org/view/json-schema
      (would really just need to make sure we store the journal 
       and action information required to build the json for a page)
    mouse tracking (to display what a co-author is doing)
    rss feed for updates to specific pages, or for new items in a tag

an easier-than-easy, lighter-than-light "wiki"

== urls 

different prefixes for different options

normal pages   ~<>
"listing"      ~<>*
list all       ~
editing pages  @<>
deleting pages !<>
login          =...
logout         -

when ~/test~page is accessed, it will try pages/test~page.md or 404

page titles are automatically capitalized -- test~page is Test Page
any charactars but alphanum are converted to ~

== access, editing

user names are kept in a file called passwd
before being allowed to edit, users are prompted for a password
edit pages are just a textarea and submit button

Maybe a wiki-ecosystem,
focusing on trust to determine abilities.


== urls 

different prefixes for different options

at present:

normal pages   ~<>
"listing"      ~<>*
list all       ~
editing pages  @<>
deleting pages !<>
login          =...
logout         -

but ultimately:

*normal pages   /<page-name>
*versions       /<page-name>~<version-number>
user pages     /~<user-name>(/<pagename)

listing        /<blob>/
*list all       /

*editing        /@<page-name>
deleting       /!<page-name>
admin          //

login          /=<redirect-url>
logout         /-

when /test-page is accessed, it will try pages/test-page or 404

page titles are automatically capitalized -- test~page is Test Page
any charactars but alphanum are converted to ~


== access, editing

user names are kept in a file called passwd
before being allowed to edit, users are prompted for a password
edit pages are just a textarea and submit button


== points

10 - starting
100 - can make changes autonamously (but can be undone if downvoted)
1000 - admin, can ice users and lock pages

each user can vote, up or down, up to a tenth of their score,
on articles, users, and changes, or yield any number of their score to another user

users gain points by getting upvotes on any action they perform


== changes

current versions of files are linked to from the main folder, where versions are held in versions/<name>~<ver>

versions are iterated up from 0
pending changes are kept in pending/
failed changes are kept in a folder for the user


== files

keep a header in each file that summarizes the modification time, user, title, score of modification, and up/down voters


== users

get a profile of their own that stores some personal data,
and their score, as well as all changes and updates they have made
